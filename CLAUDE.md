# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is `encoredigitalgroup/stdlib`, a collection of standard library classes and functions for PHP at Encore Digital Group. It provides utilities, helpers, and
standardized patterns for PHP development.

## Coding Rules

Always follow these rules when writing code:

- Casing rules:
    - Variables are always camelCase
    - Functions are always camelCase
    - Paths are always PascalCase
    - Classes are always PascalCase
- Comments and docblocks:
    - Only add comments when they add real value. Comments should always describe *why* not *what*
    - Only add minimal docblocks to help improve code intelligence and static analysis
- Never use `private`, `final`, or `readonly` keywords. If they are needed, the developer will implement them.
- Avoid magic strings when an enum or a const is an option. Look in the existing codebase for an enumâ€”it'll often be there
- Avoid variables if possible. eg. rather than calling `$response = $this->get(...)` followed by `assetsRedirect()`, just chain the calls
- Use the early return pattern where possible
- Prefer arrow functions when the line will stay under 80-100 chars
- Testing:
    - All tests should be written using PestPHP. Related tests should be grouped by `describe()` blocks.
    - All tests should be written using the `test()` function instead of the `it()` function.
    - Avoid tests that are largely testing that the code behaves specifically as it is written, and instead test the intention. eg. a validation message may change over
      time, but the invalid input should not be allowed regardless.
    - When calling eloquent factories:
        - Prefer named factory methods over `state` or passing values to `create` where possible
        - Only factory data that is relevant to the test--favor defaults otherwise
        - Eloquent factories should create necessary relationships implicitly. If you don't need a relation for the test, let the factory create it rather than creating
          it in the test.
- Always run `composer format`, `composer analyse`, and `composer test` on your code before considering it done
- If there are "todo" comments that need to be resolved before the code gets merged, use `// FIXME`

## Development Commands

### Testing

- Run all tests: `vendor/bin/pest`
- Composer Command: `composer test`
- Tests are located in `tests/` directory using Pest testing framework

### Code Quality & Analysis

- Static analysis: `composer analyse`
- Code formatting: `composer format`

## Architecture & Code Structure

### Core Namespacing

All classes use the `EncoreDigitalGroup\StdLib` namespace with PSR-4 autoloading from the `src/` directory.

### Key Directories

- `src/Objects/` - Main utility classes organized by domain:
    - `Support/Types/` - Enhanced type classes (Str, Arr, Number)
    - `Http/` - HTTP-related utilities (Url, HttpMethod, HttpStatusCode)
    - `Filesystem/` - File and directory utilities
    - `Geography/` - Geographic data structures
    - `Serializers/` - JSON/XML serialization with normalizers
    - `Calendar/` - Date/time utilities
- `src/ObjectHelpers/` - Functional helper files automatically loaded
- `src/Exceptions/` - Custom exception hierarchy
- `src/Attributes/` - Custom PHP attributes (Api, Deprecated, Internal)
- `src/Support/Internal/` - Internal support classes and composer scripts

### Helper Functions

Global helper functions are auto-loaded from files in `src/ObjectHelpers/`:

- `enum_helpers.php`
- `file_helpers.php`
- `php_function_helpers.php`
- `str_helpers.php`
- `url_helpers.php`
- `val_helpers.php`

### Dependency Strategy

- Uses Laravel collections and support packages (`illuminate/collections`, `illuminate/support`)
- Supports multiple Laravel versions (^10|^11|^12)
- Wrapper classes like `Once` check minimum dependency versions at runtime

### Code Style Standards

- Uses custom PHP-CS-Fixer rules with specific class element ordering
- PHPStan level 8 static analysis
- Cognitive complexity limits: 50 for classes, 10 for functions
- Excludes Attributes, ObjectHelpers, and Exceptions from coverage analysis

### Testing Approach

- Pest framework for unit tests
- Test files in `tests/Unit/` directory
- Some wrapper classes marked with `@codeCoverageIgnore`
